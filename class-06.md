## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

- Node.js
  - Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
  - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
- V8 engine
  - open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers.
  - Responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
- Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.
- Version manager
  - A program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will.
  - Advantages - it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
  - First it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.
  - Second it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
- Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the server
- Node,js is **event-driven** which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
- Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
- Apps Node.js is suited for:
  - building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
  - building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven or for sites involving data streaming
- Advantages of Node.js
  - Able to switch modes automatically
  - Speaks JSON
  - JavaScript is everywhere
