# Read: 14a - DB Normalization

## Database Normalization Explained in Simple English

- Database normalization
  - A process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.
- Three main reasons to normalize a database
  - To Minimize duplicate data
    - Duplicated information present two problems
      - It increases storage and decrease performance
      - It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes
  - To minimize or avoid data modification issues
    - Three modification anomalies that occur:
      - Insert anomaly
        - Facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row.
      - Update anomaly
        - If we have the same information in several rows, then inconsistencies appear.
      - Deletion anomaly
        - Causes loss of information and set of facts
  - To simplify queries
    - You can eliminate or reduce these anomalies by separating the data into different tables. This puts the data into tables serving a single purpose.
- Three common forms of database normalization:
  - 1st normal form (1NF)
    - The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
  - 2nd normal form (2NF)
    - The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
  - 3rd normal form (3NF)
    - The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
